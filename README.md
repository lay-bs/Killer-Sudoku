# Killer-Sudoku
**Killer Sudoku Validator** is a Python tool to check if a Killer Sudoku solution is valid. It verifies standard Sudoku rules (unique numbers in rows, columns, and 3x3 boxes) along with Killer Sudokuâ€™s cage constraints, where numbers within each cage must add up to a specified sum without repeats. This tool confirms if both sets of rules are met.
